# Student Relationship Engagement System

A collaborative open-source learning analytics project between New Zealand and Australian universities, focussing on a bottom-up approach to build a system that is imminently useful, applicable, and usable by teachers on the ground working with students.

Our philosophy is that learning analytics should be about empowering teachers and students with data, and that good analytics needs to focus on humans, hence the name 'Student Relationship Engagement System'.
