# Student Relationship Engagement System v2

A collaborative open-source learning analytics project between New Zealand and Australian universities, focussing on a bottom-up approach to build a system that is eminently useful, applicable, and usable by teachers on the ground working with students.

Our philosophy is that learning analytics should be about empowering teachers and students with data, and that good analytics needs to focus on humans, hence the name 'Student Relationship Engagement System'.

This system was born from the SRES v1 originally developed at the University of Sydney (see [poster](https://www.academia.edu/9378207/A_simple_web-based_analytics_system_to_efficiently_capture_analyse_and_respond_to_student_engagement_and_achievement)).

Version 2 builds on version 1 and is designed so that tertiary instituions can customise and implement to meet their own specific needs but benefit from sharing a flexible data architecture and common components.

NB: please note the current code represents a minimal viable product for a research project, and as such there is some functionality that has not been fully implemented. Anyone wishing to use or contribute to the SRES should consult the "Issues" tab for current known issues, and feel free to add new issues or feature requests.
