  <h3>Welcome to the home of the SRES</h3>
  <p>
    In the world of educational analytics, it's easy to forget that statistics are students, numbers are names, and predictions 
    affect people. The Student Relationship Engagement System (SRES) started from the belief that the best tool for ensuring 
    student success is still the teacher. 
    <br/><br/>
    SRES represents a new vision for Learning Analytics - your data, whatever way you want it. There's no black box under the hood. 
    There are no traffic lights. There are no complex modelling algorithms, automated interventions, or shiny visualisations serving
    up the same data six different ways. 
    <br/><br/>
    There's just you, and your students. 
    <br/><br/>
    After all, nobody knows them better.
