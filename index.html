  <h2>Welcome to the home of the SRES</h2>
  <p>
    In the world of educational analytics, it's easy to forget that statistics are students, numbers are names, and predictions 
    affect people. The Student Relationship Engagement System (SRES) started from the belief that the best tool for ensuring 
    student success is still the teacher. 
    <br/><br/>
    SRES represents a new vision for Learning Analytics - your data, whatever way you want it. There's no black box under the hood. 
    There are no traffic lights. There are no complex modelling algorithms, automated interventions, or shiny visualisations serving
    up the same data six different ways. 
    <br/><br/>
    There's just you, and your students. 
    <br/><br/>
    After all, nobody knows them better.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What is the SRES?</h2>
  <p>
    The SRES is an online platform designed to allow you to upload student data, filter it in a way that is meaningful to you, and 
    act on the results. The emphasis is on you - you choose the data that's relevant to your context, you filter it according to your
    needs, and you choose when and how to act.
  </p>

    <h3>Typical early warning system cycle</h3>
    The typical early warning system cycle is one between the students and the system - 
    the system sucks in student data, performs complex computations, and then automatically intervene if students match
    certain conditions - the process is quick, painless... and utterly impersonal.

    <h3>The SRES cycle</h3>
    The SRES is different - the SRES puts you, the teacher, squarely in the middle of the process. You decide what data to put in,
    you filter the data, and you intervene with your students.
